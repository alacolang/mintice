This a simple GoNogo app designed to help bipolar adolescents with
deliberate self-harm behaviors.

It consists of 10 sessions to be practiced each day. Each session contains
three blocks. In each block, the user is asked 200 questions which are
randomly Go or Nogo, which you should press the button for certain elements
or not doing anything for the rest of elements as you are told in the begining
of the block.

To motivate users, it considers a gift doing each session, which you lose on
each wrong action a bit.
